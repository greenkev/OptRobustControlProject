# OptRobustControlProject
This is the final project for ECE 669: Optimal and Robust Control at Oregon State University. This covers LQR optimal control both as a regulator and a tracking controller of a two link robot arm.

To run, execute from the directory one of the following scripts
- RunPassiveSimulation.m
- RunLQRRegulator.m
- RunLQRTracking.m

Each will run the simulation, create the plots from the final report and animate the results from both the linear system dynamics and the nonlinear system dynamics
